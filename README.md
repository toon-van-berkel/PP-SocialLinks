# Social Links
This website was built with a simple but practical purpose: to serve as a central hub for all my social media links. Instead of repeatedly listing the same profiles across different platforms, this site provides a single, easy-to-share page where visitors can quickly find and access my socials.  

The project focuses on a clean and minimal design, making the links immediately visible and user-friendly. It also gave me the opportunity to practice semantic HTML and responsive CSS layouts, ensuring the page works smoothly across devices.  

By creating this project, I explored how even a small, single-purpose site can improve personal branding and make it easier to maintain a consistent online presence. It shows that front-end development doesn’t always have to mean big, complex websites — sometimes the most useful tools are the simplest ones.
